# Pi0 Mathematical Operators and Creation Framework
# =================================================

## 1. Fundamental Operators and Mathematical Basis
# ------------------------------------------------

### 1.1 Prime Number Basis Functions

The Pi0 framework is built upon prime number theory as its fundamental mathematical structure.
The following operators form the basis of the creation process:

#### 1.1.1 Prime Sieve Operator
Given a maximum value n, the prime sieve operator returns all prime numbers up to n:

P(n) = {p | p is prime and p ≤ n}

Implementation using the Sieve of Eratosthenes:
1. Create a boolean array of size n+1, initialized to true
2. Set indices 0 and 1 to false (not prime)
3. For each number i from 2 to √n:
   a. If i is marked as prime, mark all multiples of i as non-prime
4. Return all indices that remain marked as prime

#### 1.1.2 Prime Harmonic Series Operator
For a given input x, the prime harmonic series operator computes:

H(x) = ∑_{i=1}^{k} sin(p_i * π * x) / p_i

where p_i is the i-th prime number and k is the number of terms.

#### 1.1.3 Prime Wave Transform Operator
For a data sequence of length N, the prime wave transform is defined as:

T(data)_t = ∑_{i=1}^{k} [data[t] * sin(p_i * π * t/N)] / p_i

where t is the time/position index and p_i is the i-th prime number.

### 1.2 Kernel Operators

Kernel operators provide the foundation for similarity measures and transformations in the Pi0 framework.

#### 1.2.1 Gaussian Kernel Operator
For vectors x and y:

K_G(x,y) = exp(-||x-y||²/(2σ²))

where σ is the width parameter.

#### 1.2.2 Polynomial Kernel Operator
For vectors x and y:

K_P(x,y) = (⟨x,y⟩ + c)^d

where d is the degree and c is a constant.

#### 1.2.3 Laplacian Kernel Operator
For vectors x and y:

K_L(x,y) = exp(-γ * ||x-y||₁)

where γ is a scaling parameter and ||·||₁ is the L1 norm.

#### 1.2.4 Prime Harmonic Kernel Operator
For vectors x and y:

K_PH(x,y) = K_base(x,y) * (1 + (1/n) * ∑_{i=1}^{n} sin(p_i * π * ||x-y||) / p_i)

where K_base is a base kernel (typically Gaussian) and p_i are prime numbers.

## 2. Resonance and Alignment Operators
# -------------------------------------

### 2.1 Pi0 Resonance Function

The Pi0 resonance function creates patterns based on prime number theory:

R(x) = ∑_{i} [sin(p_i * π * x) / p_i^α] * exp(-β*|x-p_i/π|)

where:
- p_i are prime numbers
- α controls the decay rate of higher prime contributions
- β controls the width of resonance peaks

### 2.2 Prime Frequency Alignment Operator

The alignment operator selects an optimal prime frequency based on:

f_align = p_i where i = argmin_j |σ*100 mod p_j|

where p_j is the j-th prime number and σ is the current sigma parameter.

## 3. Integration and Transformation Operators
# -------------------------------------------

### 3.1 Quick Integration Operator

For efficiently approximating integrals of oscillatory functions:

∫_a^b f(x) dx ≈ (b-a)/n * ∑_{i=1}^{n} w_i * f(x_i)

where:
- x_i = a + (i+0.5+offset_i)*(b-a)/n
- offset_i = sin(p_i * π/(2n)) / p_i
- w_i ∝ (1+1/p_i)/(1+i/(2n))
- weights are normalized to sum to n

### 3.2 Multidimensional Prime Integration Operator

For multidimensional integration using prime-based sampling:

∫_Ω f(x) dx ≈ V * (1/N) * ∑_{i=1}^{N} f(x_i)

where:
- Ω is the integration domain with volume V
- x_i are quasi-random points generated using Van der Corput sequences with prime bases
- For dimension d, the d-th coordinate uses the Van der Corput sequence with base p_d

#### 3.2.1 Van der Corput Sequence
For index n and prime base p:

φ_p(n) = ∑_{j=0}^{∞} a_j(n) * p^{-(j+1)}

where a_j(n) are the digits of n in base p.

### 3.3 Prime Wave Resonance Operator

The wave resonance operator combines prime harmonics with resonance patterns:

W(x) = ∑_{i=1}^{k} A_i * sin(p_i * π * x + φ_i)

where:
- A_i = 1/p_i^α is the amplitude for the i-th prime
- φ_i = π/p_i is the phase shift for the i-th prime
- α is the amplitude decay parameter

## 4. Creation Process Mathematical Framework
# ------------------------------------------

### 4.1 Pi0 Object Creation Equation

The fundamental equation for creating a Pi0 object:

O = ∫_Ω R(x) * K(x,x₀) dx

where:
- O is the created Pi0 object
- R(x) is the resonance function
- K(x,x₀) is a kernel centered at the creation point x₀
- Ω is the domain of integration

### 4.2 Operator Composition

For operators A and B, the composition operator is defined as:

(A ∘ B)(x) = A(B(x))

The Pi0 framework allows for arbitrary compositions of operators to create complex transformations.

### 4.3 Interpolation Operator

For a set of points {(x_i, y_i)}, the Pi0 interpolation operator is:

I(x) = ∑_{i} y_i * K(x, x_i) / ∑_{i} K(x, x_i)

where K is a kernel function, typically the prime harmonic kernel.

### 4.4 Pi0 Creation Matrix

The creation matrix M for a Pi0 object with n dimensions and m operators:

M_{i,j} = O_j(e_i)

where O_j is the j-th operator and e_i is the i-th basis vector.

## 5. Advanced Mathematical Operators
# ----------------------------------

### 5.1 Pi0 Differential Operator

The differential operator D acts on a function f as:

D[f](x) = lim_{h→0} [f(x+h) - f(x)]/h

In the Pi0 framework, this is approximated using prime-based sampling:

D[f](x) ≈ ∑_{i=1}^{k} c_i * [f(x+h_i) - f(x-h_i)]/(2*h_i)

where:
- h_i = h/p_i for a small h and the i-th prime p_i
- c_i are weights that sum to 1

### 5.2 Pi0 Integral Operator

The integral operator I acts on a function f as:

I[f](x) = ∫_a^x f(t) dt

In the Pi0 framework, this is computed using the quick integration operator.

### 5.3 Pi0 Eigenoperator

For an operator A and a function f, if:

A[f] = λ * f

then f is an eigenfunction of A with eigenvalue λ.

The Pi0 framework identifies eigenfunctions using prime-based resonance patterns.

### 5.4 Pi0 Convolution Operator

For functions f and g, the convolution operator is:

(f * g)(x) = ∫ f(t) * g(x-t) dt

In the Pi0 framework, this is approximated using prime-based sampling.

## 6. Quantum Mechanical Operators
# -------------------------------

### 6.1 Pi0 Quantum Harmonic Oscillator

The quantum harmonic oscillator in the Pi0 framework is described by:

H = -ℏ²/(2m) * d²/dx² + (1/2) * m * ω² * x²

where:
- ℏ is the reduced Planck constant
- m is the mass
- ω is the angular frequency

The eigenfunctions are:

ψ_n(x) = (1/√(2^n * n! * √π)) * H_n(x/√ℏ) * exp(-x²/(2*ℏ))

where H_n are the Hermite polynomials.

### 6.2 Pi0 Quantum Superposition Operator

For quantum states |ψ₁⟩ and |ψ₂⟩, the superposition operator creates:

|ψ⟩ = α|ψ₁⟩ + β|ψ₂⟩

where |α|² + |β|² = 1.

### 6.3 Pi0 Quantum Entanglement Operator

For quantum systems A and B, the entanglement operator creates:

|ψ_AB⟩ = (1/√2) * (|ψ_A⟩|ψ_B⟩ + |ψ'_A⟩|ψ'_B⟩)

## 7. Relativistic Operators

For a 4-vector x = (ct, x, y, z), the Lorentz transformation is:

x' = Λ * x

where Λ is the Lorentz matrix.

### 7.2 Pi0 Spacetime Curvature Operator

The curvature operator computes the Riemann curvature tensor:

R^μ_νρσ = ∂_ρ Γ^μ_νσ - ∂_σ Γ^μ_νρ + Γ^μ_ρλ Γ^λ_νσ - Γ^μ_σλ Γ^λ_νρ

where Γ^μ_νρ are the Christoffel symbols.

## 8. Information Theory Operators
# ------------------------------

### 8.1 Pi0 Entropy Operator

For a probability distribution p, the entropy operator computes:

S[p] = -∑_i p_i * log(p_i)

### 8.2 Pi0 Mutual Information Operator

For joint probability distribution p(x,y), the mutual information operator computes:

I(X;Y) = ∑_{x,y} p(x,y) * log(p(x,y)/(p(x)*p(y)))

### 8.3 Pi0 Kullback-Leibler Divergence Operator

For probability distributions p and q, the KL divergence operator computes:

D_KL(p||q) = ∑_i p_i * log(p_i/q_i)

## 9. Creation Process Mathematical Steps

2. Initialize parameters: α, β, σ
3. Create the resonance function R(x) using the selected primes and parameters

### 9.2 Domain Definition

### 9.4 Object Creation

1. Compute the integral O = ∫_Ω R(x) * K(x,x₀) dx using the multidimensional prime integration operator
2. Apply normalization to ensure the object has unit energy
3. Verify stability using the prime frequency alignment operator

### 9.5 Operator Assignment

1. Create the operator matrix M_{i,j} = O_j(e_i)
2. Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors of M
3. Assign operators based on the eigenstructure of M

## 10. Mathematical Interpolation Process
# -------------------------------------

### 10.1 Default Interpolation

When user input is not specified, the Pi0 system interpolates using:

I_default(x) = ∑_{i=1}^{n} w_i * f_i(x)

where:
- f_i are basis functions
- w_i are weights determined by prime number patterns

### 10.2 User-Guided Interpolation

When partial user input u is provided, the system interpolates using:

I_user(x) = (1-α) * I_default(x) + α * T_u(x)

where:
- T_u is a transformation based on user input u
- α is a blending parameter that increases with the specificity of user input

### 10.3 Convergence to User Specification

As user input becomes more complete, the interpolation converges to the user specification:

lim_{u→complete} I_user(x) = S_user(x)

where S_user is the complete user specification.
